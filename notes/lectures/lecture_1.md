## 1. Welcome to CS106A 

- Get the four handouts.
- Four handouts tell about the class.
- This is an intro programming class.
- Quick show of hands

## 2. Course Staff

Mehran Sahami is the professor.
Ben Newman is the TA.
Section Leaders.

## 3. Why is the class called Programming Methodology?
Why is the class called Programming Methodology?
	• Supposed to teach good engineering principles
	• Mechanics of a language are one thing, and engineering principles are another
		○ Books can teach mechanics, not necessarily principles
		○ This class teaches the principles
	• Programs are like essays
		○ Need to know a language
		○ Knowing the language, like Java, doesn't make you a good writer
		○ Knowing how to write is key

So this class uses Java to teach good software engineering principles.
Self taught programmers can be good, but they can also have developed bad habits.

This class wants everyone to do well.


## 4. Are you in the right class?

Is this the right class for you?
	• CS106A: no programming experience needed
		○ Can be hard, but prepares you to be software engineer
		○ Also you don't have to be, goal is to just make everyone more computer literate
	• CS105: bare minimum for general education if you really don't want to learn computers unless you have to
	• CS106X: accelerated version if you want to go fast, have experience

Handout 1: class web page
	• www.stanford.edu/class/cs106a

## 5. Class Logistics

The class is 3-5 units.
	• Undergrad 5 units
	• Grad 3 units if wanted because of unit cap

3 classes a week, with 1 section meeting a week
	• I can't do the section
	• cs198.stanford.edu/section

Books
	• Karel the robot learns Java
	• The art and science of Java


## 6. Assignments and Grading 
Assignments: there are 7
	• Count more the later

Coding
	• Use Eclipse

Get to meet with section leader every assignment to talk about how to improve your software engineering.

Grading
	• Will be check if works
		○ B to A-
	• Check + is solid
		○ A
	• Check - 
		○ B to B-
	• +
		○ A+
	• -
		○ C
	• ++
		○ WOW
		○ Beyond requirements and is amazing work
		○ Teachers cry from how good it is
	• --
		○ Also cry
		○ No effort

Get two free late days (class day) for late assignments.
3 days late is a zero.

Two exams: midterm and final.
	• Outside of class, 7-8:30 pm on a date (Oct 30th in class time schedule)

Grades:
	• 45% assignments
	• 15% midterm
	• 30% final
	• 10% participation

Honor Code:
	• Handout 4
	• Don't share code
	• Don't copy someone's code
	• Cite collaboration

Time:
	• Units * 3 = hours of time per week
	• So for this, 10 hours a week


Now class.

Debugging comes from:
	• Mark II at harvard was one of the first computers
	• Computer was breaking
	• Found a moth in the computer that was breaking it
	• Took this bug out and the computer worked again
	• The woman who was the computer scientist of the computer found this bug and pasted it in the lab notebook

Not starting with Java to start programming.
	• Simple place to start and teach the programs

Karel the robot
	• From Karel Copek (came up with the word robot)

Karel lives in a grid.
Grid has streets (horizontal) and avenues (vertical).
Karel can move in the grid, turn, and sense things like walls.
Beeper is a diamond that is a marker.
Karel has a bag for beepers. He can pick them up, and his bag has beepers.

First week will be with Karel, which is a great transition into Java.

I downloaded the materials and actually the website is there as static files.
