Lecture 13

More work on Strings and characters today.

Midterm goes up to lecture 14.
	• Know the book as well that is in the reading list

Next assignment is string processing.

Note that str.substring without a second integer argument takes a slice from the index to the end of the string.


Tokenizers
	• Tokens are strings that are surrounded by whitespace
	• "hello there, Josh" -> tokens are "hello", "there,", "Josh"

So a string tokenizer splits a string by the whitespace characters.
A string tokenizer is included in java.util.*
The delimiters are space, tab, and newline.
So tokenizers let you split strings based on a delimiters.


Encryption
	• One common method is the Caesar Cipher
		○ Shift letters in a string by some number of letters in the alphabet
		○ The number of letters to shift, n, is the 'key'
	• 'plaintext' is the input of a ciper, and the encrypted message is called 'ciphertext'

Standard string replacement idiom:
```
string result = "";
for (int I = 0; I < str.length(); i++) {
	char ch = str.charAt(i);
	ch = changeCharMethod(ch);
	result += ch;
}
```
