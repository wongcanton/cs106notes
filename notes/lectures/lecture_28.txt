Lecture 28

Results of a Graphics Contest is discussed.
Final is open book.

Final Review:

On the final:
	• Chapters 2-13 (not Karel, no history)

Not on the final:
	• History
	• Karel
	• Stack/Heap diagrams
	• Bit operations
	• Polar coordinates
	• Layouts
	• Sorting
	• Threads
	• Standard Java

To emphasize:
	• Build a program
		○ Declare a class and be able to run it
	• Objects, classes, interfaces
		○ What does it mean to implement an interface
		○ Be able to define a class and make constructors
		○ Method calls
			§ Pass by reference vs pass by value
		○ Primitives vs objects
	• Strings and characters
		○ String operations
			§ Write out for reference during final
		○ Using individual characters
	• Graphics
		○ acm graphics
	• Event-driven programs
		○ Mouse listeners
		○ Action listeners
	• Arrays and ArrayLists
		○ Differences
		○ When to use each
		○ Multidimensional arrays
	• Collections
		○ HashMap
			§ Key/Value
		○ Iterator
	• Files
		○ Read from file

There is a practice final.

Some additional practice questions:

For:
	HashMap<String, String>
	Find matching key/value pairs

public void MatchKeys(HashMap<String,String> map) {
	Iterator<String> it = map.keyset().iterator();
	while (it.hasNext()) {
		String key = it.next();
		String value = map.get(key);
		if (value.equals(key)) {
			println(key);
		}
	}

}
