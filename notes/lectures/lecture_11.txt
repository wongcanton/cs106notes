Lecture 11

Gimage
	• Lets you put images on the collage
	• `new Gimage(image_file, x, y)`
		○ The file must be in the project folder, in a 'images' subdirectory
		○ .gif, .jpg, and .jpeg supported

	• Can do image.scale(x, y) to scale it differently

GPolygon
	• Can draw polygons
	• Has a reference point, and the corners are passed in reference to the position to the reference point
		○ The reference point is easiest if the center
	• How to make one:
		○ Make empty polygon
		○ Add verticies in reference to the reference point
		○ Set vertex with addVertex(x, y)
			§ All other verticies can be added with addVertex(x, y) 
			§ or addEdge(dx, dy)
				□ Adds vertex relative to the preceding one
		○ Closes the polygon by linking the first and last verticies
	• The reference point is never said explicitly when drawing it
		○ You pass the reference point when you add it to the canvas
		○ `add(diamond, 75, 100);`
Note that polar coordinates not used in this class.

GCompound
	• Allows multiple GObjects to be added together and use as one GObject 
	• Also has a reference point: add all objects relative to the reference point
	• When added to the canvas, pass the reference point

Remember that when adding ovals: the coordinate is the top left corner of the rectangle that the circle is drawn in
--------
|   O  |
|        |
--------
	• So the circle is at 0,0 where 0, 0 is the top left corner

One strategy for making a compound object is to make a class that extends GCompound, make all objects relative to the reference point for the main object, then make instances of that class in the program.

Event-Driven Programs
	• When users interact with the program, like clicking a mouse or typing, its an event
	• We respond to events by having 'listeners' for events
		○ if no listener, we never know the event happens
	• Typically we have two listeners:
		○ addMouseListeners()
		○ addKeyListeners()
	• The library for these are java.awt.event.*
	• Some methods of listeners can be called asynchronously
		○ When you don't know exactly when it will happen
	• For GraphicsProgram, we use a listener instead of calling run()
	init() -> Make the listener in this method, in place of run()
	mouseClicked(MouseEvent e) -> Defines the behavoir when a click is heard by the listener
	
General responding to mouse events:
	1. init or run method that makes addMouseListeners
	2. Write definitions of any listener methods needed

getElementAt(GPoint) finds the top most object at a location (GPoint location)

I just realized there are no solutions to the assignments.
There are solutions to the exams and the section assignments. I should do the section assignments.
