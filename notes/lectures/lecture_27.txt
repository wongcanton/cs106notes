Lecture 27

Topic of today:
	• Life after CS106A

Computer Science is not 'computer programming'. There's a lot more to it.

CS106B is 'Programming Abstractions'. It's in C++.
	• It goes over implememting things like the HashMap
	• Goes over recursion, for example

CS103: A, B, or X. This is on Discrete Math.
	• Discrete math covers things like sets, computability
	• Is p = np? This is a $1M problem
	• Also goes over graph theory

CS107 and CS108: 
	• 108 = Object oriented systems, large systems
	• 107 = low level programming (on hardware)

Topics:
	• AI, start with CS221
		○ Robotics
		○ Computational Biology
		○ Data analysis
	• Graphics
		○ Animation
		○ Digital photography
	• Databases
		○ Search engines
	• Cryptography
		○ Security
	• Machine Learning
		○ Spam filtering
	• HCI (human computer interaction)

Some other classes:
	• Operating systems: start with CS140
		○ Lots of systems classes
	• CS161: Data structures

Careers:
	• CS + business
		○ Can be a product manager
		○ Entrepreneurship
		○ Finance (computational)
	• CS + biology
		○ Bioinformatics
		○ Genomics
		○ Proteomics
		○ Bioengineering
	• CS + law
		○ IP
		○ Copyright
		○ Patents
	• CS + CS (just cs…)
		○ Programming (software engineering)
		○ Engineering management
		○ Teaching
			§ CS198 = section leader for CS106A/B
			§ Companies like picking these students because they are known to be good at programming but they can also communicate
