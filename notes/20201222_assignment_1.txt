20201222 Assignment 1

Notes:

My hope is that the assignments are the same from 2007 to 2017.

They are not.
Solve the assignments from 2017 for now.

The first assigment is CollectNewspaperKarel.
The goal is to:
	• Move to the newspaper (beeper)
	• Pick up beeper
	• Move back to the initial position

The assignment recommends to make methods for the first and third actions.

Can make new worlds according to handout #3?
	• Make solutions for the preprovided worlds first, then make additional worlds for testing.
