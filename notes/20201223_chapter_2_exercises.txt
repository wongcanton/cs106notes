20201223 Chapter 2 Exercises

To run java programs, I'll need to compile them.
I installed the most recent jdk here:
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk15-downloads.html

I should be able to run them on my system now.

I need to install the acm.program package before I can run anything.
https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/jtf/
Get the acm.jar

Nevermind this is too much for now. Just wait to see in lecture if they talk about how to run java files in eclipse.


I got it much later.
I downloaded a blank java project here:
https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106a/cs106a.1178//resources/BlankJavaProject.zip
I then put my java programs using the acm package in the /src/ folder. They run in eclipse that way.

The way they made the acm.program platform for the class, as defined here:
https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/jtf/
requires the use of pre-defined project trees and use of specific jar files.

For now, use this boilerplate setup to focus on the programming as is in the class, and focus on general java use later.


Exercise 1:
Change hello world to say "I love Java" and have my signature at the bottom right corner
Done

Work on next one. So far I'm copying the BlankJavaProject for each assignment, since it has all of the boilerplate files I need in this environment.
